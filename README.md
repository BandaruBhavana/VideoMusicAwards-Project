The VMA voting website is a platform where users can vote for their favorite music videos.

The website also displays the nominees in each category and allows users to view and vote.

Database and Class Description

This VMA voting web application imports modules such as Flask, render_template, request, session, redirect, url_for, escape, send_from_directory, and make_response. It also imports classes for the User, Student, Nominee, and Vote.
This web app creates a Flask application instance and sets the configuration for server-side sessions, including the secret key and session type. It also sets up a route for the home page, which displays the results of the votes and enables or disables voting based on whether a user is signed in or not, It also sets up a route for submitting votes, which gets the database connection, retrieves data from the request, and inserts the vote into the database.It sets up a route for the sign-in page, which handles both GET and POST requests. If the request method is GET, it renders the sign-in template, otherwise, it retrieves the email and password from the request, checks if the email and password match the database records, and if so, sets the session for the user and renders the home page template. Otherwise, it renders the sign-in template with an error message. It sets up a route for the admin page, which is only accessible to users with the admin role. It retrieves the results of the votes and nominee objects and handles POST requests for deleting or adding nominees to the database.
It also sets up a route for managing users, which can handle both GET and POST requests and can insert or update user data into the database.
In the baseobject.py file, there are three classes defined to represent each of these tables. The User class represents the users table, while the Video class represents the videos table. The Vote class represents the votes table. Each class contains attributes that map to the columns in the corresponding table.
